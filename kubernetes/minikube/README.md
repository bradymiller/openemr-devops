# Overview
OpenEMR Kubernetes orchestration on Minikube. Creates 5 instance of OpenEMR with 1 instance of MariaDB, Redis, and phpMyAdmin.

# Use
1. Install (and then start) Kubernetes with Minikube: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/
2. To start OpenEMR orchestration:
    ```bash
    bash kub-up
    ```
3. Can see pod progress with following command:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pod
    ```
      - It will look something like this:
          ```console
          NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
          mysql-565f988976-np9zs        1/1     Running   0          133m
          openemr-5f6db6c87c-8xgzq      1/1     Running   0          133m
          openemr-5f6db6c87c-bfktf      1/1     Running   0          133m
          openemr-5f6db6c87c-bwzdr      1/1     Running   0          133m
          openemr-5f6db6c87c-qn5ll      1/1     Running   0          133m
          openemr-5f6db6c87c-znq8h      1/1     Running   0          133m
          phpmyadmin-78968d6cfb-cdfmq   1/1     Running   0          133m
          redis-74cc9d667-5ltbq         1/1     Running   0          133m
          ```
4. Can see the service listing with following command:
    ```bash
    kubectl get svc
    ```
      - It will look something like this:
          ```console
          NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                         AGE
          kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP                         151m
          mysql        ClusterIP   10.109.255.180   <none>        3306/TCP                        147m
          openemr      NodePort    10.104.48.53     <none>        8080:31314/TCP,8090:30613/TCP   147m
          phpmyadmin   NodePort    10.97.77.18      <none>        8081:30571/TCP                  147m
          redis        ClusterIP   10.98.24.148     <none>        6379/TCP                        147m
          ```
5. Can get the link to go to OpenEMR with following command (use the top link for http and bottom link for https):
    ```bash
    minikube service openemr --url
    ```
      - It will look something like this:
          ```console
          http://192.168.99.100:31314
          http://192.168.99.100:30613
          ```
6. Can get the link to go to phpMyAdmin with following command:
    ```bash
    minikube service phpmyadmin --url
    ```
      - It will look something like this:
          ```console
          http://192.168.99.100:30571
          ``` 
7. To stop and remove OpenEMR orchestration (this will delete everything):
    ```bash
    bash kub-down
    ```
8. If wish to use the most recent codebase rather than 6.0.0-dev docker, then can change from openemr/openemr:6.0.0 to openemr/openemr:flex in the openemr-deployment.yaml script (note this will take much longer to start up (probably at least 10 minutes and up to 90 minutes) and is more cpu intensive since each instance of OpenEMR will download codebase and build separately).
9. Note this is not supported by 5.0.2 docker, which is why it defaults to using the 6.0.0-dev docker.

# Development notes
How this was built.
1. Downloaded the OpenEMR Docker Swarm example as docker-compose.yml (kept this modified script for historical purposes): https://gist.github.com/bradymiller/980086836af187285bf28b8db9eecabc
2. Made following changes in above file:
    - mysql need to change utf8 to utf8mb4
    - change openemr/openemr:5.0.2 to openemr/openemr:6.0.0
3. Ran komposer on the above script
4. Made changes to openemr-deployment.yaml:
    - place quotes around all the environment values
5. Increased storage claims in the 3 volume claim scripts to be `1Gi` or `10Gi` (websitevolume)
6. Added mysql service and redis service scripts
7. Added type NodePort in OpenEMR and phpmyadmin service scripts
8. Changed PMA_HOSTS from mariadb to mysql in phpmyadmin deployment script
9. Changed mariadb:10.2 to mariadb:10.5 in mysql deployment script
