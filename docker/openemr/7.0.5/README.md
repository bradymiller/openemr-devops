# OpenEMR Official Docker Image

The docker image is maintained at https://hub.docker.com/r/openemr/openemr/
(see there for more details)

## Performance Optimizations

This image includes significant performance optimizations that reduce startup time by **~5x** and memory usage by **~70%** compared to previous builds.

### Benchmark Results (November 2025)

| Metric | Optimized Image | Previous Build | Improvement |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Startup Time** | 15.0s | 73.1s | **4.9x faster** |
| **Memory (Average)** | 92.8 MB | 304.2 MB | **69% reduction** |
| **Memory (Peak)** | 117.1 MB | 326.6 MB | **64% reduction** |
| **Performance** | 114.9 req/s | 117.2 req/s | Equivalent |

*Measured using Docker's internal timestamps (`State.StartedAt` → first healthy `State.Health.Log`)*

### Technical Explanation

#### 1. Build-Time File Permissions (Primary Optimization)

**Problem**: The original image set file permissions at runtime during container startup. This required scanning ~15,000+ files with `find` and `chmod`/`chown` commands, which took 40-60 seconds on each container start.

**Solution**: File permissions are now set during the Docker image build process:

```dockerfile
# During build (Dockerfile)
RUN ... \
    && find openemr -type d -exec chmod 500 {} + \
    && find openemr -type f -exec chmod 400 {} + \
    && chmod 666 openemr/sites/default/sqlconf.php \
    && chmod 700 openemr/sites/default \
    && find openemr/sites/default/documents -type d -exec chmod 700 {} + \
    && find openemr/sites/default/documents -type f -exec chmod 600 {} + \
    && chown -R apache:apache openemr/
```

**Result**: Container startup no longer needs to scan and modify permissions for the entire codebase. Only files that change during setup (like `sqlconf.php`) need permission adjustments at runtime.

#### 2. Memory Reduction via Linux Page Cache

**Problem**: Runtime file scanning caused the Linux kernel to cache all scanned files in the page cache, inflating memory usage to 300+ MB even when the application wasn't using that memory.

**Technical Detail**: When `find` traverses directories and `chmod`/`chown` access file metadata, the kernel loads file inodes and directory entries into the page cache. For ~15,000 files, this creates substantial memory overhead that persists for the container's lifetime.

**Solution**: By moving file operations to build time, the page cache remains minimal at runtime. Only actively-used application files are cached.

**Result**: ~70% reduction in memory footprint (305 MB → 92 MB average).

#### 3. Simplified Runtime Entrypoint

The `openemr.sh` entrypoint script was optimized to:
- Skip redundant permission operations that are now handled at build time
- Use efficient `find -exec {} +` syntax instead of `xargs` pipelines
- Only modify permissions for files that actually change during setup

### Permission Scheme

| Path | Permissions | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Directories | `500` (r-x------) | Execute needed for traversal, no write |
| Files | `400` (r--------) | Read-only for PHP execution |
| `sites/default/` | `700` (rwx------) | Writable for site configuration |
| `sites/default/documents/` | `700`/`600` | Writable for document uploads |
| `sqlconf.php` | `666` | Writable during initial setup |

### Reproducing the Benchmarks

To verify these results on your system:

```bash
cd utilities/container_benchmarking
./benchmark.sh
```

## Tags

See the https://hub.docker.com/r/openemr/openemr/ page for documentation of tags and their current aliases.

It is recommended to specify a version number in production, to ensure your build process pulls what you expect it to.

## How can I just spin up OpenEMR?

*You **need** to run an instance of mysql/mariadb as well and connect it to this container! You can then either use auto-setup with environment variables (see below) or you can manually set up, telling the server where to find the db.* The easiest way is to use `docker-compose`. The following `docker-compose.yml` file is a good example:
  - If you are using Raspberry Pi, then change the `mariadb:10.11` to `jsurf/rpi-mariadb`.
```yaml
# Use admin/pass as user/password credentials to login to openemr (from OE_USER and OE_PASS below)
# MYSQL_HOST and MYSQL_ROOT_PASS are required for openemr
# MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASS, OE_USER, MYSQL_PASS are optional for openemr and
#   if not provided, then default to openemr, openemr, admin, and pass respectively.
version: '3.1'
services:
  mysql:
    restart: always
    image: mariadb:11.8
    command: ['mariadbd','--character-set-server=utf8mb4']
    volumes:
    - databasevolume:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
  openemr:
    restart: always
    image: openemr/openemr:7.0.5
    ports:
    - 80:80
    - 443:443
    volumes:
    - logvolume01:/var/log
    - sitevolume:/var/www/localhost/htdocs/openemr/sites
    environment:
      MYSQL_HOST: mysql
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASS: root
      MYSQL_USER: openemr
      MYSQL_PASS: openemr
      OE_USER: admin
      OE_PASS: pass
    depends_on:
    - mysql
volumes:
  logvolume01: {}
  sitevolume: {}
  databasevolume: {}
```

## Environment Variables

See the https://hub.docker.com/r/openemr/openemr/ page for documentation of environment variables.

## Support on Raspberry Pi

Both 32 bit and 64 bit architectures are supported on Raspberry Pi. If you are using Raspberry Pi, then you need to change the `mariadb:10.11` to `jsurf/rpi-mariadb` in the above docker-compose.yml example.
