# OpenEMR Official Docker Image

The docker image is maintained at https://hub.docker.com/r/openemr/openemr/
(see there for more details)

## Tags

Tags and their current aliases are shown below:

 - `flex` and `flex-edge`: (special development dockers that can use OpenEMR version from any public git repository and/or support local/testing development environment)
 - `5.0.2`: next
 - `5.0.1`: latest
 - `5.0.0`

## How can I just spin up OpenEMR?

*You **need** to run an instance of mysql/mariadb as well and connect it to this container! You can then either use auto-setup with environment variables (see below) or you can manually set up, telling the server where to find the db.* The easiest way is to use `docker-compose`. The following `docker-compose.yml` file is a good example:
```yaml
# Use admin/pass as user/password credentials to login to openemr (from OE_USER and OE_PASS below)
# MYSQL_HOST and MYSQL_ROOT_PASS are required for openemr
# FLEX_REPOSITORY and (FLEX_REPOSITORY_BRANCH or FLEX_REPOSITORY_TAG) are required for flex openemr
# MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASS, OE_USER, MYSQL_PASS are optional for openemr and
#   if not provided, then default to openemr, openemr, admin, and pass respectively.

## Environment Variables
Required environment settings for flex are `FLEX_REPOSITORY` and (`FLEX_REPOSITORY_BRANCH` or `FLEX_REPOSITORY_TAG`). `FLEX_REPOSITORY` is the public git repository holding the openemr version that will be used. And `FLEX_REPOSITORY_BRANCH` or `FLEX_REPOSITORY_TAG` represent the branch or tag to use in this git repository, respectively. An exception to the above required settings for this image is if the user sets EMPTY environment setting to yes; then this image will not install any openemr in it (this gives a developer flexibility to set up shared volume(s) from host).

Required environment settings for auto installation are `MYSQL_HOST` and `MYSQL_ROOT_PASS` (Note that can force `MYSQL_ROOT_PASS` to be empty by passing as 'BLANK' variable).

Optional settings for the auto installation include database parameters `MYSQL_ROOT_USER`, `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASS`, `MYSQL_DATABASE`, and openemr parameters `OE_USER`, `OE_PASS`.

Can override auto installation and force manual installation by setting `MANUAL_SETUP` environment setting to 'yes'.

Can use both port 80 and 443. Port 80 is standard http. Port 443 is https/ssl and uses a self-signed certificate by default; if assign the `DOMAIN` and `EMAIL`(optional) environment settings, then it will set up and maintain certificates via letsencrypt.
